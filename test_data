On the day of the school Christmas show, the school loved the musical and cheered for Joe and his friends when it ended. Joe and his friends celebrated by going out for ice cream.

There once was a beautiful, brown puppy who loved her life.  Her name was Tori.  Every morning, Patty brushed out her fur and feeds Tori her favorite breakfast.  One Tuesday morning, Patty had an early errand and forgot all about Tori.  Tori was sad, but chose to make the best of it, and leaped out of her doggy door to play in her backyard outside.  As she was playing with her favorite ball, Tori saw an opening in the fence.  Excited, she ran over to the fence and squeezed out.  She had never been on the street by herself before.  Tori ran down the sidewalk, and happily barked at all the other dogs she passed.  She loved to wag her tail in the summer breeze and was having a great time.  

All of a sudden, Tori was picked up by Ben and Mike, and thrown into a truck.  She was lost and confused.  Poor Tori didn't know what to do!

Once the workers took her inside, they put her into a cage.  She was scared that Patty wouldn't know where to find her, but she knew Patty's phone number was on her collar.  She barked and barked to get the worker's attention, but no one seemed to pay her any attention.  

After two long hours, a tall man, named Joe, opened up her cage and looked at the charm on her collar.  He smiled at Tori and gave her a pat on the head.  Patty was there quickly, and gave Tori a big hug.  She was so happy to see her puppy again.

One day John and Sally's mother made up her mind to bake a very special cake for her son and daughter, but she didn't have the ingredients. She told John and Sally to go to the grocer's to buy the things she would need.

"I'll need some popcorn, a pea, some melon balls, and a cup of yogurt. I'm going to make a very special cake today," she said.

"Wow, that sounds horrible," said John.

"Yeah, we'd rather watch TV and eat potato chips," said Sally.

"Don't talk back, kids. Do what I said and head into town. It's a beautiful day. Go the long way and follow the river until you get there. Don't take the short way through the forest. A lion has escaped from the zoo. He might be hiding in the forest."

So John and Sally started the walk into town, but because they were disobedient children, they didn't follow the river like their mother told them. Instead they took the short way through the forest.

So they wandered along the forest path, jumping in mud puddles and throwing sticks at one another. But as soon as John and Sally were in the darkest part of the forest, they heard a terrible roar. It was the lion! Horrified, they ran for their lives out of the forest, all the way back home.

Jane was good at basketball but she liked soccer more.  She played forward for her soccer team on Saturday morning.  A man in a black and white striped shirt blew his whistle to start the game.  It was hot so Jane's coach handed out orange slices for the players to eat at half time.  Jane's team was winning but she was more excited for what she would do in the afternoon.  Her father was going to take her to watch a baseball game.  When the soccer game was over, Jane took off her soccer shoes and put them next to her father's running shoes in the back of his car.

Today was the Moon's birthday, and Ms. Star wanted to be sure to get the best gift ever for her friend Moon. She had no idea what she was going to get him! A rainbow sounded like a fun gift, but everyone has a rainbow, and she was sure that Moon had one too.
Ms. Star looked all around space for the right gift for Moon. She asked Saturn was she was going to get Moon. "Oh, I think I'm going to get Moon a space puppy. He was talking about how much he loved dogs!" That sounded like such a good idea to Ms. Star, but since Saturn was going to get a space puppy, that meant that Ms. Star couldn't do it too!
"Try asking Mars." said Saturn. "He might know what to get Moon."
Ms. Star asked Mars. "Well," said Mars. "I know that I'm getting Moon a space ship, and that Neptune, Uranus and Pluto are going together to get Moon a new house."
"Wow!" said Ms. Star. "How am I ever going to get Moon something as nice as a house, or a space ship, or a space puppy?"
Mars thought about it for a little bit. "Hmm." he said. "Maybe you could make him something?"
"What a great idea!" said Ms. Star. "I know what would be perfect to make for him!"
That night, at Moon's birthday party, when Moon opened the gift from Ms. Star, he was the happiest he had been about any of the gifts. "It's the perfect gift! Thank you so much Ms. Star!"

My cat's name is Buggleton. She is black and white with big green eyes and very long whiskers, like a bug.

When I woke up this morning, my cat was not inside the house. She is allowed outside, and we have a cat door in the kitchen so she can come and go as she pleases. She comes home at night, sleeps in her special box, and is here for breakfast before going outside for new adventures. We can lock the cat door so she can't go outside when we go on vacation. If we go on vacation for more than a few days, my mom comes over to check on her and feed her.

There was once a small, grey cat that lived in the woods. This was a lonely old cat that spent most of his time bullying other small animals that lived in the woods. Almost all of the other little animals who lived in the woods knew of the old cat, and warned everyone they knew to stay away from him. 

One day a young mouse was out taking a walk to collect some berries. It was a nice day out, so the mouse chose to go down by the river to take a quick rest for a bit. When the mouse arrived at the river he found the perfect spot to rest. It was a small little area with soft sand to lie on, under a tree that gave a bit of shade. The mouse then sat back. After a little bit of time the mouse was fast asleep. 

Not long after the mouse had fallen asleep, the cat caught a scent in the air of the young mouse. The cat walked slowly up to the spot where the mouse was sleeping and licked his lips. Right when the cat was about to catch the mouse, the mouse woke up.

"What are you doing?!" asked the mouse in surprise. 

"I am trying to find dinner," said the cat. 

The mouse smiled. "I collected extra berries today on my walk. Would you like to have some?"

The cat was confused. He had never been given such a kind thing. "Well, OK. Berries are not my favorite, but I guess that they are OK."

Sherry went out her back door and put on her sunglasses, large hat and heavy cloth work gloves.  She knelt in front of her small garden and started to pull weeds, throwing each in a small trashcan nearby.  As she worked she listened to the sounds of her neighbor's boys, Sam and Carl, playing. Sometimes she stopped long enough to sip from her bottle of water.

Her work and the heat of the day tired her out quickly, so she put her gardening tools away, dumped the weeds into the larger bin, and went back into her house to cool down and do some of the other items on her to-do list.

She had hurried when she had crossed the road, and slipped and ended up going to the hospital. Because she was not being careful enough, she was stuck in bed, eating crackers and watching television. Just as Kira was on her fourth hour of television, her mother knocked on her door. "Kira," she said. "Your friends are here." Kira looked up to see her two best friends, Lexie and Jamie. They were grinning. "Kira," Lexie said, "We got you something." When they entered, Kira saw that they had a giant pumpkin with them. Jamie was carrying a set of paints and paintbrushes.

The birds chirped, the sun beat down on a nearby window, and the noisy sound of an alarm clock tried to let me know it was seven in the morning. Not only that, but the sound of a high pitched voice, announcing "It's here! It's here Janet, it's here!" That voice belonged to my sister, Karen. What she meant was that the day had finally come for our family trip to the nearby beach located beyond Eagle Point. She got our parents out of bed way before they were ready to be up, but they knew how much it meant to her so they put a smile on as mother made breakfast and father packed the family car with towels and umbrellas. We could barely hear him say how there wasn't much room for many items, but he fit it all together like every year. I warned him last go around to get something larger like a truck, or a van, even joking an airplane, but he stuck to his guns and stayed with cars.

Truthfully, I had forgotten about the trip and made plans with my friends, Lauren and Matthew. As sad as I was to have to back out, I called the two of them and let them know of my mistake. They understood, and soon after we all entered the car and went on our way to the beach. The ride and the actual activities were pretty fun! We went swimming, met some new families, and got a little reading in. Karen wanted to play in the sand, but there was a piece of metal nearby so our mother wouldn't let her.

Once there was a white horse named Bob, who lived in a house with his best friend. His friend was a cat named Shelly who loved to play baseball. The two of them would go to the park and play baseball with Lucy a lamb who lived next door.

"This is going to end badly, I'm afraid," Shelly said, throwing the melon at Bob who stood over home plate.
"I know what I'm doing," Bob said, swinging the bat as hard as he could. When the bat hit the melon it splatted into a million pieces, raining sticky pieces down on Bob and Shelly and Lucy and a wedding party that had been setting up nearby.

I was really scared walking into school today. It was the first day of sixth grade and I was excited to be leaving elementary school, but I ended up going to a different middle school than all my friends since I moved across town last year. My name is Matt, but I'm going to try and not let anyone else know that as I'd rather sit in the back and keep to myself. I didn't want to ride the bus, so my mom said she would drive me there for today. Thankfully I found my classroom, but I walked in and saw nobody I knew, as I thought. I took a seat at an empty table as the teacher, Mrs. Frank took roll call. She seemed nice, and I'm happy we weren't told to sit in alphabetical order or by boys to boys and girls to girls, as I was free to sit by myself for now. Mrs. Frank called out Jimmy, Sally, Linda, Jason, and then finally got to my name in which I raised my hand quickly. As soon as she was done, a few of the kids who arrived late came to sit by me and said their names were Martin and Mark.

Martin said he liked how our names all sounded the same, and Mark seconded that as we started talking before class began. When it was time to eat, we all said we would sit with one another in the lunch room, and also when it came to recess and playing together. It was nice to have some friends after being so nervous earlier, and see that everything does work out in the end. Hopefully soon we can all play together outside of class, but as far as today, it was a great start!

A man sailed out to sea in a small boat. The sun was only rising, but this man liked spending all day fishing. A long way away from the shore, he stopped his boat.

One day, a boy named Sam went to the doctor because he fell and hurt his knee. He was riding his green tricycle in the yard when it happened. He played with yellow and red blocks in the waiting room before his visit with the doctor. His mother was sitting in a chair, reading a magazine and talking to other mothers sitting around her.

Dr. Curtis

On a small farm outside of town, lived a boy named Curtis. Curtis was seven years old and he wanted to become an animal doctor someday. He always loved animals and helped take care of them on his family's farm.

Curtis liked to feed the horses, chickens, pigs, dogs, and the cat. He also like to help take care of them when they got hurt or sick. Once, Curtis stayed in the barn all night, helping his father with a sick pony. The animal doctor was there too, and Curtis watched everything that he did. The doctor had to keep giving Bonnie the pony some medicine. And he kept checking her eyes and mouth.

When the pony got better, the animal doctor went home. But Curtis and his father stayed in the barn with the pony until it became light outside. Curtis had gone to sleep, so his father carried him to their house and put him to bed.

"That can wait. Right now you need to eat something. I saved you some bacon, Mr. sleepy head," his father said as he smiled at Curtis.

Curtis washed, dressed, and ate as fast as he could and then raced to the barn. He stood on a stool and looked into Bonnie's eyes and mouth. He put his head on her chest and listened to her heart. Then he checked her legs and tail. He tried to do everything the animal doctor did and more.

Curtis saw his father standing at the door and said, "Everything looks okay, daddy. I think she can go out to the big tree with the other horses."

There is a large tree in a park where all the kids in the neighborhood can hang out and play.  The tree was planted in 1896 and has grown to over fifty feet tall with branches that were another thirty feet wide.  Next to the tree is a jungle gym.  The jungle gym has two slides, a fireman pole, a rock climbing wall, and much more.  One day the kids in the neighborhood came up with the idea of building a tree house so they could spend all of their time at the park, even when it was raining outside.  The children all went to their parents begging them to help and get wood.  The families of the neighborhood began building the master tree house.  Upon completion the tree house was ten by twelve feet high, with two windows, and plenty of space for the children to have fun.

Jane was a dog who lived all alone, in a broken freezer in a dump. There was all kinds of junk in the dump, from a car, to a wooden cow, to a clock, but Jane's favorite thing she had was a giant sock. Jane was always chewing at the sock, and kept it with her in her freezer.

There was once a frog who lived all the way in the North Pole. His name was Isaac. He worked at Santa's factory, baking cakes with lots of frosting. He didn't like making cake much. In fact, Isaac's dream was to work in the factory with the elves making toys. But since he was a frog, he was never allowed to build toys with the elves. One day, he got a smart idea. He would dress up as an elf and sneak into the factory, hoping no one would find out. So he got a hold of an elf costume and put it on. He put on the elf hat, the elf shirt, and the elf shoes.

Millie thought she would like to stop eating meat, but she didn't know if she could do it.  Once, when she was younger, she had tried to go without eating meat, but before the first day was over, her stomach had felt a little empty.  "Hmm," she had thought.  "Maybe it's not good for me to stop eating meat.  Maybe that's why I feel so hungry."

I once was the leader of running a skills camp for a Boy Scout group. The weekend long camp included a lot of different games. One of the games was for fire-building. The point of the game was to help teach campers how to best build fires. There are many different ways you can build a campfire. You can build a lean-to campfire. You can also build a teepee fire. To build the fires you must find and sort different sizes of sticks and brush and larger logs to get the fire going. The goal of the game is to build a fire big enough to burn a string that is hanging a few feet above the ground.

Right before they are finished picking their flowers to surprise their mother, the girls see that the clouds in the sky have turned grey and that the sun is no longer shining. It looks like it's going to rain soon.

Abby looks down at her small hand of purple flowers and frowns.

"What's wrong, Abby?" Emma asks, turning to look at her sister studying her flowers. 

"Well," Abby says, "We got the flowers, but it looks like rain."

Emma looks up at the cloudy sky and nods.

"If it rains, we can't make mommy a mud pie," Abby adds with sadness. 

Emma looks down at her own white flowers, counting them, and thinks. After making sure she had four flowers, she looks at Abby with an idea. 

"What if we get the mud and take it in the house? That way if it rains, we can still make a cake," Emma says. 

"Good idea!" Abby smiles, happy again. 

Flowers in hand, the girls grab a yellow pail, placing their flowers on the porch, as they walk towards the mud to get what they need for their mother's birthday cake.

It was very warm for February. Anna and her brother, John, played outside in the beautiful, sunny weather. Dad was washing his car. When Mom came home with the groceries, Dad sent the kids to help carry bags. They ran to the garage to help her. But when they got there, Mom was kneeling on the ground near where their bikes were parked, petting a gray cat with long hair.

"Can we pet her?" Anna asked.

"Be careful," Mom said. Anna knew these directions were for her brother, who was often rough with things.

"She's fat," John giggled.

"She's not fat. She's pregnant," Mom told him.

"What's that mean?" John asked.

"It means she's going to have kittens." Anna said. "Can we keep her?" Anna begged. "Please?"

Mom and Dad looked at each other.

"We could take her to the pound, or she could stay outside here," Mom said. "Long-haired cats give you rashes."

"But you always said you wanted one," Dad told Mom. "Short-haired cats don't bother me, and if she stays here, we have to give the kittens away. Let's send her over to your parents' farm. She can live in the barn, and then if one of the kittens has short hair, we can keep that one."

The kids were excited. They named the cat Socks because she had white feet, and they went to visit her every day. Socks had her kittens in April, and, to everyone's excitement, two of them had short hair. Dad said that since they were brother and sister, they could keep both kittens.

On a sunny day in July, Sylvia left the front gate open. From the spot where Rex was napping in the grassy yard, he had listened to the sound of the gate sliding open, and waited for it to snap shut. It didn't. The click of Sylvia's shoes faded into the distance, and yet the snap of the shutting gate didn't come. Finally, Rex pushed himself up on one paw so he could look towards the front of the yard, where the gate moved in the breeze. Rex moved slowly towards the gate at first, but as he neared the sidewalk he shot through the opening, his shiny black fur twinkling in the sun as he sped down the street. Rex ran from block to block through the neighborhood, with no leash to pull him back. When all four legs started to burn from running, Rex slowed down and started sniffing the grass around him. His stomach growled and he hoped he'd find some food in the grass. All he found was sidewalk chalk, a few little black ants, and flowers that made him sneeze. The sun was going down, and Rex thought about Sylvia coming home to rub his ears and fill his food bowl. He looked up and down the sidewalk for his home. Nothing. Rex was lost. He stood completely still and raised his ears as high as they would go. He sat and listened, and listened and sat. Just as the sun passed over the mountains in the distance, Rex heard, from very far away, the soft "click click click" of Sylvia walking towards the house. Rex ran home.

When I was a little boy, I could remember my mom making breakfast and dinner for us. And I remember one night, when she had made dinner after a long, hard day at work. On that evening, my mom placed a plate of vegetables, salad and burned chicken breast in front of my dad. I remember waiting to see if anyone saw, yet all my dad did was to reach for his chicken breast, smile at mom and ask me how my day was at school.
