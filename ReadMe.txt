To run the program there is two things to do
1. Training
Python3 QALSTM_train.py
 
1. Testing
        Python3 QALSTM_test.py


All the necessary file that is read for the input and preprocessing are called indirectly and all are placed in the folder P3. 


The Libraries that are need for the code to run are

* math
* random
* numpy
* tensorflow
