Billy was like a king on the school yard. A king without a queen. He was the biggest kid in our grade, so he made all the rules during recess. He was a big bully.

There was once an old tree. The children from all around the neighborhood loved to climb the tree. The children also liked to sit under the tree, hang on it and play games around it. Animals liked the tree as well. Birds, cats and all kinds of lizards would climb the tree too! Rabbits, dogs, frogs and and many ground animals loved to play around the bottom of the tree.

One day the children learned the tree was going to be cut down. This made the children, and maybe the animals, very sad. Why was it being cut down? Was it too old? Too weak? Maybe it was dying? The children learned it was because the tree was sick.

John was so happy he rushed off to tell his friends. "Big news!", he shouted. "My parents told me a new tree is going to be planted here over the old one!"

Max was a little dog that loved to ride the train. Every day when the sun came up Max would run down to the stop and wait until the train stopped and jump on. He thought this was the best time of his life. He always wore a blue collar and a red piece of fabric. Except for on the weekends he would wear a green collar. Sometimes when Max would run next to the train, he would get a splash of mud on his fur. His friend, Bob, didn't like it when Max came home dirty.

Joey went to the doctor yesterday. He was a little scared because he might have to get a shot, but his mother promised that it wouldn't hurt. During the time they were in the waiting room, Joey played with some blue and green blocks and some toy cars that the doctor kept there for the children who came to see him. He also met another little boy named Bobby who also had to see the doctor. Bobby liked playing with the cars more than the blocks, but Joey liked playing with both of them.

Every day at noon, when it was time for recess, Mrs. Snooter would honk a loud horn. This was the signal that told her third grade class to go outside and start playtime.

The students in Mrs. Snooter's class always tried to get to the front of the line in order to make sure they were the first outside. As soon as the doors opened, the whole class would race to the seesaw at the back of the playground. However, it was not an easy race. There were many things between the door and the seesaw that needed to be passed, and Mrs. Snooter's third grade class enjoyed the excitement that they added to the race.

First, the students had to pass the kindergartener's sandbox. This may sound simple, but the kindergarteners would often trap students by digging large holes in the sandbox. If students jumped over the holes, they might have sand thrown in their eyes.

If a student could pass the sandbox test, the next problem was the jungle gym. The fifth grade class came to recess before Mrs. Snooter's class and would hang out on top of the jungle gym. They thought they were cool because they were the oldest kids in the whole school, and would not let any other classes come near the jungle gym. It was difficult, but some students in Mrs. Snooter's class would make it past.

Finally, there was a long run to the seesaw. Only a few students would still be racing at this point, and they would run as fast as they could. Every day, there was one boy who would push himself a little harder than the other students. Most of the time, he was the winner of the race, and would play on the seesaw with his friends.

There once was an alligator named Albert (who wore an office shirt). He had two good friends - Lock the cat and Gary the hamster. Gary often rode around in Albert's shirt pocket, since it would be hard for him to keep up with Albert and Lock as they walked around. One day, as they were wandering around, a storm popped up, forcing them to hurry indoors to deal with it. Unfortunately for them, they couldn't find a building quickly, so they ended up being frosted over by the dangerous weather. "If we don't get out of this soon, I might die!" yelled Gary, who was cold. "Don't worry, no one's going to die!" yelled Albert, who, as a reptile, was even worse off than Gary.

There was once a pig named Oink, who lived on a farm, but spent most of his days in a factory making shoes. In his free time, he would make drawings about how much he wished he could fly. He would look up at the stars in wonder, hoping that some day, his dream might come true. For many years, his life carried on this way. He would wake up on the farm, go to work, and then come home to dream about flying. That is, until one day, he got a letter with a strange sticker on it, that was shaped like a star. He opened the letter in excitement, wondering what it said. The letter said that Oink was invited to a special party that took place every year in the clouds. Animals from all across the world were chosen so that they could know what it's like to fly. If he chose to go to the party, he would get his own set of wings to fly up into the sky and meet the other animals. Oink was so happy, he barely knew how to react. He accepted the invitation, and two days later, got a package containing his wings. Oink's dream was finally coming true. He put the wings on his back and flew up into the sky, where the party was being held. Once he arrived, he saw a bunch of other animals with wings also. He saw horses, dogs, cats, and plenty of birds. Oink had found out that it was the birds who had invited everyone, since they wanted the other animals to know what it is like to fly. Oink spent that day flying in the clouds with his new friends. But when the clock reached midnight, he knew his time flying was up, and he had to return the wings and go back to his farm. But the birds told him that they saw how much he enjoyed flying, and would allow him to keep his wings so he could fly with them whenever he wanted.

They spent the whole day together and ate their lunches together next to the pond.  Kevin sure enjoyed the park more than he liked going to the beach or store.

Kevin tried everything he could to have the chipmunk come out with his keys, but he couldn't find out how to make the little guy give up.  Finally, Jessica came over and placed a potato chip at the opening to the hole.

Once upon a time there was a boy monster named Jerry who lived in a train car at the railroad tracks. He had lived there all his life. Jerry's mother was named Marge, and she was 36. Marge raised Jerry at the railroad tracks because she wanted to keep him safe. She was afraid of the people who lived in the town nearby. The town was named Qarth, and 100 people lived there.

When summertime came Jack the Pirate made up his mind it was time to get his hair cut.

"Your friends won't even know it's you, Jack!" said Edward the Barber as Jack the Pirate headed out the door.

On the way back home, he took a short cut through the forest, and he met three people who were his friends. First he met Ichabod the Chief of Police, who was doing an important case. Jack said "Hello, Ichabod!" but Ichabod ignored him. The second person he met was Willy the Candy Man, who was delivering delicious treats. Jack said "Howdy, Willy!" but Willy didn't say anything back. The third person Jack met was Dean the Librarian, who was looking for a book he had lost. Jack said "Hey, Dean!" but Dean didn't stop looking for his book.

There once was a giant orange farm in space. No human had ever been there before. It could not be reached by plane, spaceship, car, or any other means of travel. The farm was run by large squirrels, and was started in 1032. They owned the planet the farm was on, called Etopit. In the year 2037, one brave man named Hugo wanted to travel to Etopit to see the farm. On Earth, it was known the squirrels grew better oranges than any other animal, including rabbits, dogs, and horses. Hugo wanted to learn the squirrels' secrets and bring them back to Earth. Hugo was no normal man. He could sneeze so hard that it would send him flying into the air. Hugo put on a squirrel costume, and had his friend Ralph tickle his nose for 7 hours. Hugo sneezed so hard he flew into space and landed in Etopit. The squirrels did not know he was a human because of his costume. Hugo met Rufus and Xenon, 2 of the most power squirrels in space. He told them his name was Tiddlywink, and that he was sent by the squirrel king from Etopit's moon Rebeti to help them grow even more oranges. Rufus and Xenon told him all their secrets.

Tomorrow is my best friend's birthday and I don't know what to get him. He's eleven years old like me, and to be honest, everyone likes to always mix us up. It's not that we look alike or sound alike or even dress alike, but it's our names, Tim and Tom, that do it. Anyways, he likes dinosaurs, board games, and toy cars so I'm not sure if anything under ten dollars has both of those in it. He also told me not to get anything that has feathers included in it as his mom always gets headaches when she's around them.

My mom took me to the store and I looked around for something Tom would like. We had to pass through the clothing, medicine, and jewelry sections before we got to the toy aisle. My mom told me to not let her forget that we need to go to the garden section to get a new sprinkler before we go, but I was too into the toys to understand her. Finally, I found a board game where you play as different cars to try and finish a race first and thought that was perfect even without the dinosaurs. From there, we checked out and I gave the present to Tom on his birthday. He loved it and we played with our other friends, Daryl, John, and Angie. Sadly our other friend, James couldn't make it as he was sick, but we still had so much fun together.

Jamey really wanted a pet dog, so he went to ask his parents.

"Mom, Dad, can I we get a dog?"

Jamey's mom and dad thought about this, and then answered him. 

"Having a pet can be a lot of work, Jamey. When you own a dog, you have to feed him, and take him for walks, and clean up after him. You even have to do those things when you would rather be playing or watching TV. If you promise to help take care of him, we'll get a dog."

Jamey was very happy to hear this! The next weekend, his mom and dad took him to a big building where puppies and kittens without homes were kept. It was very noisy inside! Jamey looked at a big yellow dog first. 

"This dog is pretty big, Jamey," his father said. "He might need a bigger yard to run around in than we have."  

Jamey thought that Dad was right about that. The next dog Jamey looked at was a very small white dog. It barked over and over again as Jamey and his mother looked at it.

"This dog is very noisy Jamey. He might need a lot of attention from you. Do you think you want to give this puppy that much attention?"

Jamey wasn't sure he could give the little white dog all the time it needed to be happy. Finally Jamey looked at a third dog, a brown dog that was bigger than the white dog, but smaller than the yellow one. The dog came over to Jamey right away and seemed to love to be petted and fussed over.

"Do you like the brown dog?" asked Jamey's dad.

"Yes!" said Jamey. "Can we get him?"

"Will you feed him and walk him every afternoon when you get home from school?" asked Jamey's mom.

"I promise," said Jamey.

Kerry was playing with his toy airplane in the backyard after school one day when he saw something moving in the corner of the yard. He put down his toy and went over to look. He found a small frog, about two inches cross, jumping across the grass.

Carefully, Kerry followed the frog as it jumped across the grass. He didn't know where the frog had come from or where it was going, but he knew that frogs needed water. He wanted to help the frog.

He ran inside and got a plastic pail that he used to use at the beach for sand. He filled it up with water and brought it to the backyard.

It was a short way to a nearby creek running through his neighborhood. Kerry walked slowly, trying not to spill the water. The pail seemed to grow heavier and heavier as he walked.

I spend every morning walking around to see the zoo. It's better than any animal book. I say hello to the lions. I say woof at all of the wolves. I make faces to the penguins. Once I even gave a morning kiss to a bear! My favorite animal is the piggy. I named him Samson. He likes to eat mustard, so I toss some mustard jars into his cage every morning. I don't know why that piggy likes mustard so much.

Sometimes I walk around with the Zoo King and Zoo Queen. Then we say hello to the animals together! I really like those days. Everybody who works at the Zoo says hello to us when we walk by.

Twinkle Toes was a very special kind of spider because his tenth new skin would be pink instead of blue. When it was time for Twinkle Toes to turn pink, he was very excited, but he was also worried. He was afraid that his best friend, an orange cat named Morty Roo, wouldn't know that the pink spider was Twinkle Toes in his new skin. He was scared that Morty Roo would mistake him for a normal spider who does not change colors. If Morty Roo saw a spider who wasn't Twinkle Toes, he would likely kill the spider and eat it. Twinkle Toes was hoping to tell Morty Roo that he would soon turn pink, but Morty Roo didn't come around to visit that day. Twinkle Toes called over Woofington, the neighbor's dog.  Twinkle Toes asked Woofington to please tell Morty Roo that he would be pink after he grew his new skin but would still be the same Twinkle Toes he had always been.  Woofington normally liked to chase Morty Roo around the neighborhood. He knew he would have to be nice to Morty Roo to deliver the message and that it would be really hard. Because it was so important to Twinkle Toes, Woofington said he would deliver the message. Woofington had a special respect for spiders because they eat other bugs. Woofington is afraid of other bugs because they could bite him and make him sick.

Johnny walked toward the time machine. His adult neighbor, the scientist, had asked him to watch it for him for the weekend. He had also asked Johnny not to touch it. But it was a time machine. Johnny had to see it.

The machine was big and silver and shiny and looked like an ice cream cone that had been dropped. It had a square hole as tall as Johnny and it hummed like a fridge.

Johnny took a deep breath and stepped inside. Just a peek, he thought.

There were three buttons inside. One said "past," and one said "present." Another said "space."

Johnny looked at the buttons. He looked at the buttons some more. He waited and without thinking, his arm jumped out in front of him. He pushed the button that said "past."

There was a bright light! And bam!

Johnny stepped out of the machine. It was raining, and there were many strange looking trees. The air was warm. The dirt below was muddy.

He took a deep breath. "So this is the past," Johnny said.

Just then he heard a bump. And another one. The ground shook. The bumps got louder and the ground shook harder. A tree fell.

Johnny heard a roar.

Two more trees fell.

Suddenly, Johnny saw it: A Tyrannosaurus Rex!

Johnny was so scared he couldn't breathe.

The T. Rex looked up, and left, and right. He sniffed the air and leaned down. He didn't seem to see Johnny.

Then Johnny sneezed. And the T. Rex started walking towards him. Faster and faster. Bump. Bump bump. Bumpbumpbumpbump until he was running.

Johnny jumped back into the time machine and pressed "present."

There was once a magical lightning wand that contained special powers. When held by a human, it is believed to have given the human special powers that would allow them to take over the skies and the sea. Because of its dangerous power, a king named Ogthar wanted to hide the wand on a planet where no one could find it. Before Ogthar went out to hide his wand, he had to tie his shoelaces. Instead of tying them with his hands, he waved the wand to make it do it for him. Instead of tying his shoes, the wind and sky blew the shoes right off of Ogthar. Ogthar cried and cried because he no longer had shoes. After 17 days of crying, Ogthar saw that his life was not terrible without shoes, because he still had a magical wand.

Watermelon turned around.  Off in the distance, it saw the rock.

"But Rock, you are so far away!  Can you come closer?"

"No, I can't.  I am a rock.  I am big and flat and heavy.  I am not round like you.  I can't roll to join my friends.  I can't play with everyone like you can.  My shape is no good.  No good at all.  But I want to play!  I want to talk!"

"That is a very sad story, Rock.  But what can I do?"

"Can you roll?"

"Well, yes, yes I can."

"Then roll over here!"

And so Watermelon did.  They talked for a long time.  They sang songs.  They played games.  It was so much fun that Watermelon did not see the weather was changing.  Suddenly a strong wind blew, and it pushed Watermelon away.

"Help!  Help!  I am rolling away, help!"

"Quick, Watermelon!  Get behind me!"  Rock was afraid for his new friend.

Watermelon rolled behind Rock, and there it was protected by Rock from the dangerous wind.

"You saved me!  Thank you"

"No problem!"

"You may be big and flat and heavy.  And maybe you can't roll around like me.  But I am very happy because of that!  I am safe because you are what you are!"

I'd had the piggy bank for a long time. So long, in fact, that I don't really remember getting it. My aunt once told me a whole story about it, in which it was passed down through the family for many, many years, only to come to me. I was pretty little at the time, so I believed her with no question. It made me think that the bank was important. It became some sort of sign of family and togetherness. I would imagine my mom and my grandmother and even my great grandmother before that, putting coins in the little white pig and waiting for them to fill it up, to be spent on some sort of treasure. And then, when I was fifteen, I broke it.

I didn't mean to. I was cleaning my room in a hurry, so I could finish quickly and go to a friend's house. I swung the vacuum hose around too quickly, knocking the pig's shelf, and down it went. About a thousand pieces, and way fewer coins than I would have believed, flew everywhere. I started to cry.


My mother came in at the sound of the crash. 
"I'm so, so sorry!" I cried. "I broke the bank! I broke the family bank!"
"What, Sarah?" my mother asked, kneeling next to me on the floor. "The what?"
"The bank! Aunt Tracy said it was in the family for years!"

On his way, he passed the red house where John lives, the green house where June lives, the white house where Barack lives, the blue hat store, and the orange house where Jessie lives. He finally reached the store at 5 o'clock. 

Corky thought about buying some other things too. He looked at the potato chips, but didn't like the flavors they had left. All of the normal flavored ones were gone.

Corky thought he'd eat them on his way home. He waited in line until it was his turn, and then paid Abe the cashier. Abe gave him his change and wished him a good day.

On his way home, Corky ate his cookies. He had hoped to buy peanut butter cookies, but the store never has those. Instead, he bought sugar cookies. He liked them very much too, so he wasn't at all upset. When he got home, he poured a glass of milk and finished his cookies.

Juno was a very playful dog but she was also very disobedient.     One afternoon Juno was out in the front yard playing tag with Sasha the kitten, when Billy came to fetch her for her bath.  Juno did not like baths very much and she ran away every time Billy got close to her.  Billy soon got tired of Juno's game, so he left her in the garden hoping she would keep running around and tire herself out.   Sasha the kitten followed Billy and Juno was surprised to find herself alone, she had hoped Billy would keep on playing this fun game.   To pass the time she watched some birds building a nest in a tree, Juno was so bored she even tried to play hide and seek with George, the parrot.  Finally, since there was nobody to play with Juno laid down to take a nap.
A little later Billy came back out into the yard to fetch Juno.   What Billy didn't know was, Juno had been sleeping since he left and she was ready for another game of catch me if you can, her favorite game.  Juno took off running as soon as she saw Billy.   Billy sat down on the grass to wait.  Billy found a ball and started to throw it for Juno to fetch.  Billy kept on throwing the ball and Juno kept on bringing it back until  Juno dropped the ball and lay down on the grass, panting, tired out.      Billy quickly slipped the collar and leash on her.   Billy got Juno on her feet and the two of them walked round to the back yard where the family were sitting outside enjoying the sunshine.   Billy's father called him to come and enjoy some ice cream with them but Billy said no, he'd rather get Juno's bath time over with and then he could enjoy his ice cream.   Billy knew he had to hurry or his brothers Allen and Greg would finish the Rocky Road ice cream which was Billy's favorite.
Billy tied Juno's leash to the fence and then he brought the hose over and switched it on.  Juno   immediately tried to run away but she had no choice but to stay there and let Billy soak her.   Billy quickly added soap to Juno's coat and soon she was covered in soapy suds.   Soon Billy once again turned the hose on Juno to rinse all the soap out of her coat.   The last thing to be done was to rub Juno down with a towel and dry her off
Once Billy had finished he took the collar and leash off and Juno lay down in the sun happy that bath time was over once again.   Billy went to join the rest of the family and his father said he could choose between Chocolate Chip, Caramel Delight, Cookies and Cream or Rocky Road ice cream.

His parents were out and dropped him at the babysitter's house at 12 o'clock. Lunchtime had past, but later the babysitter fixed him a dinner of some kind of brown meat. Under the meat was a slice of dry toast. Timmy didn't like the dinner and wished he had spaghetti or pizza. Even if it wasn't what he wanted, the meal filled his tummy and stopped the hunger pains.
  
Timmy was bored and wanted something to do, but he didn't have any toys. All he had was some paper, his toothbrush and toothpaste. He wished he was home where he had left his favorite toy race car and train. The house was quiet and nighttime was near. He pretended he was camping. It was 8 o'clock and the streetlight came on and shined through the curtain, making scary shadows on the wall.  

He looked through the trash in the babysitter's extra room but couldn't find anything useful. If he at least had some markers or crayons he could draw some pictures, but he didn't even have a pencil. 

Timmy thought for a bit and found he could make a toy boat. He folded the paper into a mighty ship.   In his imagination the little boat was in a storm on a dark sea. Danger was all around.

The cat woke up from its nap under the couch. Poking his head out from under the couch, there were no dogs there. He walked out from under the couch and stretched out his paws along the hard wood floor. Far outside there was some barking from the dogs, but he was safe from them for now. The smell of tuna was in the air and the cat followed the scent to the kitchen. A woman was making a tuna sandwich for her two kids. When she finished, she put the tuna can on to the floor.

Once upon a time, there was a little white mouse that lived on a farm. He liked to hide in the hay stacks where it was warm through the day and night. On cold winter days, he would wiggle out from the hay stack to get closer to the lamp in the barn, getting some extra warmth. One winter day, the mouse was very cold, but needed something to eat. He left the hay stack, and ran past the lamp. He ran across an old wood board that was laying on top of the snow - the mouse didn't have mittens and wanted to keep his feet warm. He ran and ran until he couldn't any longer. The cold weather was keeping every living thing inside, so the mouse was all alone. He walked towards the house and met a little bug named Fred. Fred told the mouse that he went inside and found lots of crumbs to eat on the kitchen floor. The mouse waited until the farmer's wife, Julie, came out the back door, and then the mouse ran into the kitchen. There were bread crumbs everywhere! The mouse ate as many as he could before anyone found him. He heard the back door open again, and hid under the oven. It was warm there - there must have been a pie baking. Farmer Bill liked pies more than bread, cake, or cookies. The mouse stayed there to warm up, then ran back to the barn to sleep for the night.

Once there was a fish who had lived his whole life in his bowl. He often got bored and wished to see the rest of the world, but because he was a fish, he couldn't leave the water. So one day he made a special fish suit that would allow him to walk on land and breathe air like humans. He knew this would change his life, and make him rich, but first he would have to test it out.

He put the suit on and leaped from the bowl that until now had been his whole world. The suit worked! Now he could go where he wanted.

I like to go to the park that is next to the hotel. The park is very big and has lots of ladders and slides. My favorite thing to do at the park is to swim in the lake. The lake is small but there are a lot of red fish that live in it. There are also some turtles and worms at the bottom of the lake. Sometimes the fish swim by my leg and make me laugh and feel happy.

Another thing I like to do at the park is to feed the animals. There are lots of pigs, squirrels and raccoon living in the park. Sometimes I feed them bread and crackers.

So, there was this kid named Jack that came up to my beanstalk one day. I couldn't believe my eyes, so I put down my ham sandwich I was eating and looked at him. I'm not sure what he thought he was doing there, but he sure did talk a lot. He kept asking me questions about this and then he asked me some questions about that and I was getting a little bit tired of all of the questions.

When I thought I wouldn't hear the end of everything, this Jack kid asked me about the one and only secret that I've always kept to myself. That no one even knew about! No, it wasn't about my golden guitar or even my goose that laid eggs filled with coins. No, he was asking me about my beans and their roots.

They're what helps us get down to the little person world when we need to. I became a little bit worried as the little kid asked more and more questions about my roots. I didn't want to tell him that my roots were hidden in the library!

I walked over to him to pick this little kid up to get him to quiet down about the bean roots, well, he got me with his little knife and I dropped him! Thankfully, he didn't get hurt or I would've been so sad! 

He ran down the beanstalk when I chased after him. I guess he wanted to get back to his little people. I didn't follow him, but I sure hope he doesn't come back for my stuff.

When Timmy got to his grandma's house, she was standing at the door waiting for him. She had a plate of cookies in her hands and was very excited to see him. 

"Hi, Timmy!" She said. 

"Hi, Grandma!" Timmy said. "I'm so happy to see you!"

Grandma smiled. "We're going to have so much fun today, Timmy. I have ham sandwiches, chips, and fresh lemonade for lunch, and I also have a whole plate of warm cookies all for you."

"Wow, Grandma, that sounds great! I brought some games for us to play. This is going to be a great day!" 

Grandma and Timmy went inside Grandma's house and Timmy opened his bag of toys to show Grandma. She looked at the car, the puzzle, and the games, and then looked at Timmy. 

"Well, Timmy, what do you want to do first?" She asked. 

Timmy chose the puzzle, and they spent a few hours putting it together. Then, they ate lunch. The sandwiches, chips, lemonade and cookies are all delicious. Timmy ate three whole cookies by himself. After lunch, they played outside with the car, and then when they got tired, they sat on the porch and rested. It was starting to get dark out. 

"I had a great day, Timmy," Grandma said. 

Timmy smiled. "Me too, Grandma. I love spending time with you!" Timmy thought it had been a perfect day, even if he couldn't bring his dog.

I had always had fun playing in the dirt growing up, digging, throwing, building, smashing, everything, so this year for my birthday my mom and dad had bought me a gardening kit to grow my own vegetables. It came with a watering pot, a shovel, a rake and seeds! The next morning we all went out to the backyard to start our garden. We dug a bunch of small holes with my new shovel, put a seed or two in each hole, and covered them up with dirt and raked over them. Our dog was very confused because he's the one that digs the holes. Every day I would get so excited to water them and see how big they'd gotten. Every day they would get even bigger. That was the most exciting part! Then they started making little tomatoes, and they sort of looked like grapes. And those too got bigger and bigger and started turning red.

First off, let me say that my name is Lilly, and as I'm sure you know, today's my birthday! Working at the pet shop has been my dream ever since I was a little girl, so actually getting to work with and help take care of the kitties, puppies, lizards and all sorts of animals is the coolest thing to happen to me.

I'll say, like many people, I do have fears and that fear is snakes so I won't get to take care of them!

	I arrived at the pet store around nine in the morning and was greeted by the friendly woman that owned it who I talked with over the phone. Her hair was covering her name tag so I couldn't tell if her name was Martha, Margaret, or Mary, but it turns out she told me it was Margie so none of them were right. Margie helped me become friendly with all the animals, and I had so much fun the whole day. I fed them, gave them water, and even got to play with them! Margie didn't think I was ready to clean up after them yet so she said that could be done another day. It was everything I ever hoped and I can't wait for tomorrow!

My mom loves zucchini so I also planted ten zucchini plants. I watered the garden daily with a watering can. When weeds started to take over, I pulled them back. About a month in, I started getting fresh vegetables every day. I walked to the garden with a big basket every morning and picked the vegetables that were ready. Sometimes I ate them right off the vine. One day I walked down to the garden and saw that the zucchini plants were taking over.

Randy was a boy who loved to eat spaghetti. One day he met a girl named Hilda. People said that Hilda made the best spaghetti in the world. So Randy wanted to try some of Hilda's spaghetti. He asked Hilda, "Hilda, would you make me some spaghetti please?" Hilda said, "Sure! Just come to my house tomorrow!" So the next day Randy went to Hilda's house, sat down in the dining room, and waited.

Then Hilda came out with a big plate of spaghetti with spinach soup. The only problem was that the spaghetti was bright blue. Randy said, "This spaghetti is blue! The soup is blue also!

Many, many years back, in a place full of magic, there lived a man and a woman who were married. The man and woman did not love one another or anything else. The man was a wood man and often spent days alone in the wood. One day the man spent more time in the wood and he became lost. After days and days he grew hungry and weak. When he thought for sure he was going to die a tall wizard appeared before him. The man did not know the wizard had placed a spell on him, making him get lost, but he did.

The wizard smiled at the man in a friendly way and said to him, "I can show you the way out of the woods, if you give me the one thing you love most in the world."

Since there was nothing that the man loved, he said yes at once. The Wizard showed the man the way home and then disappeared into the wood. The man and woman lived well for many years and the man never told his meeting to the wizard and after a time, he too forgot about his promise. 

In time the woman gave birth and the man had a daughter who he loved. One day the wizard came to the door to take the girl, making the man remember his promise. The man was very sad to lose his daughter. But in the end he had to give her over to the wizard. The wizard was bad and locked the girl away in a cave. Every day the girl grew to be prettier and smarter. Every day the Wizard asked if the girl would marry him, but he was mean and she would not marry him. And every time the girl said no, the wizard would find a new way to make her sad. But the girl had found a secret flower that was very beautiful.

"If you marry me I can let you out."

"There is a lovely bit of sunlight that comes in through the rocks. I am very happy here in my cave." The girl said. The wizard became angry and steam poured from his eyes

He blocked out the sun so the girl lived only in darkness. Still the girl said no. The wizard came back again and told the girl, "If you marry me I can let you out." The wizard became angry and steam poured from his mouth

"There is a lovely stream of water that comes in through the rocks. I am very happy here in my cave." The girl said. The wizard became angry and steam poured from his ears

He blocked out the water so the girl lived only in dry sand. Still the girl said no. The wizard came back again and told the girl, "If you marry me I can let you out."

Again, the girl only said "There is a soft wind that comes in through the rocks. I am very happy here in my cave." The wizard became angry and steam poured from his ears and fire came out of his eyes

So the Wizard blocked out the wind and left the girl in a hot cave with no air. But the girl would still not marry him. The wizard became so angry he turned to flame and burned up. The girl was free and went down to her flower only to find it was gone. Instead she found a handsome prince. 

"I thank you my lady," he said, "for saving me from the evil wizard. In return you may come live in my palace with me and be happy."

The girl said yes. In time they came to love one another and got married and lived happy together.

One hot summer day in August my family and I wanted to go to the beach.  We had not gone to the beach in a very long time and felt that today was a great day to do it. 

We piled everyone into the car-my mom, my dad, my sister, my dog, and me. I begged mom and dad to let me sit in the front seat, but they said no.  I had to sit next to the smelly dog instead for the whole trip. 

When we got to the beach and opened the car door our dog raced down to the water to play. I grabbed the large umbrella we brought and walked down to the sand with mom and dad. After we had found a spot, they let me go play in the water. 

It felt really good to cool off in the ocean water on such a hot day. As I swam around I saw many cool things, like fish, seaweed, and shells. I brought the interesting shells that I found to a bucket I had on the beach and threw them in. They would be great to add to my collection at home.

When I got tired of swimming, my sister and I wanted to make a sand castle. We built towers using buckets and dug a huge ditch with our shovels. When our castle was complete we were about to take a picture, but then the dog ran it over and smashed it. I was about to yell at the dog, but then mom said it was getting late and we had to go home.

It was a cold day when John made up his mind to go outside and check the fence.  There had been things missing from the back yard, and he was starting to think there was a criminal at work.  He put on his coat and started walking through the snow back to the long metal fence at the back of the yard.  It seemed like a lot longer walk than last summer when it was hot.

When I'm reading my favorite book, sleeping, or when I'm showering, my hamster needs to go back to her home. I think that she is going to pee without warning and at the worst times, I am going to scratch her little belly and love her all the more when she pushes carrots into her mouth. I am sure that my little hamster is going to get into a lot more trouble, too. Maybe she'll be scared of thunder and try to run away. Or maybe she'll be so curious about going outside to the street that she might get hurt.  I do not care about the amount of trouble that my little hamster gets into I'll always make sure she has water to drink, food to eat, and love from my heart.

Thunder can move a seesaw. This is very important to know if you ever see what I saw. One day, I was walking home when I saw a squirrel on a seesaw near my house. It was running up and down, and all around, playing by itself. Suddenly, an ox appeared from nowhere. It came up to the squirrel, walked around the seesaw for a bit, then sat down on one end. As you know, an ox is a very big animal, so the seesaw threw the squirrel off and high into the air! The squirrel flew so high that it passed the buildings. It passed the birds, it passed the planes and stopped in the clouds. When it was there, it made friends with the clouds and asked one of the clouds a secret question. The cloud said okay, and sent the squirrel back to the ground. The squirrel fell and fell for a long time. Finally he landed on the seesaw, but the ox didn't move. "Where were you?" the ox asked, "Just talking with a friend," answered the mouse. I was watching and listening to everything, so I stayed, waiting. Soon enough, a loud CLAP of thunder came from the clouds and threw the ox off of the seesaw and far, far away. So, you see, thunder can move a seesaw.

Pester came running into the room. He came to a fast stop when he saw the dog. He'd seen a dog before, every cat has, and he used to live with a black dog named Henry, but he'd never seen a brown one before. It seemed strange to him, but not as strange as it was to see Linda the brown chicken in the living room last spring. That still confused him. 

He thought he liked this dog, not because of the color, but because it was small. And it was so hairy. It was a like a mop that could run around. He jumped on his favorite chair and looked down as Maggie ran under it. She was kind of cute for a dog, Pester thought to himself. He layed down on the chair and pawed at her as she ran in a circle under it. He tapped her ears as she went by, and waved his tail like a flag trying to get her attention. After a little more of this, Pester curled up in a ball on the chair and took a nap.

One day, a pink moon was looking down at an empty sand land. Although the pink moon could see all the lizards and cacti in the empty sand land, nobody could see the moon! The pink moon felt so lonely. So, the pink moon called on the sun for help. The great sun was very busy high in the sky, for it was his job to shine over the sand land, and it was hard to get his attention. So the moon wiggled closer and closer to the sun every second. The second turned to hours as the pink moon inched toward his friend, slowly moving across the sky. Finally, the sun saw the moon and asked, "Pink moon! What are you doing here? Don't you know the sky is my home during the day? Your time is coming soon enough. Look, I'm falling now toward my bed on the end of the earth..." But the pink moon could not be stopped and kept moving toward the great sun. "But great sun, I become so lonely during the day when your light is so bright the animals in the sand land can't see me. Please let me join your light during the day this once!" By this time, the great sun and pink moon were only inches apart. The great sun said, "Though by day you disappear, I always remember you are here. Come to me now. Stand in front of me, and show the sand land your shine!" So the pink moon inched in front of the great sun. At first, covering part of the sun's circle, then more, then...a complete covering of the sun!

But...I'm not sure a butt fork is the best way to eat spaghetti.

One morning, I woke up and went downstairs for breakfast. I fixed my normal breakfast: hot pickles, marshmallows, and ketchup. First I heat up the pickles on the stove, then I put the marshmallows in the toaster as I pour out my small plate of ketchup. Delicious! I eat it every morning, often with a tall glass of lemonade.

I sat down at the table to eat, and looked out the window at the birds in my yard. Sometimes I see skunks outside, and once I saw a small pot-bellied pig. But today there were only a few flamingos. I opened up the book I was reading, "All About Birds." I had finished the chapter on pigeons, and was moving on to robins.

While putting ketchup on my marshmallows, I felt something tickling my neck. I looked down, and there was a daddy long-legs, climbing up! I had never seen one so close to my face. 

"Er, what's up?" I asked. 

"Not much," he said. "I smelled the hot pickles, and wanted to have a taste."

"Sure, little guy," I said. I put a small piece of pickle on my finger and held it out. While I was doing that, that sneaky daddy-long-legs ran down my arm. He grabbed the rest of my pickle, and ran out the door! And that was the last time I gave a pickle to a spider at breakfast.

Sammy loved playing baseball. He would play every day, even if there was no practice that day! One day, Sammy went to the park with his mom to play catch with his friends, but as he was playing, he tripped over a rock, and his shoe slipped off! His shoe went flying into the air, high up into the sky, and Sammy watched as the shoe fell into old man Mr. Grumpy's yard.

Sammy's mom took him straight to mean old Mr. Grumpy's door, and knocked on it. "Oh no!" thought Sammy, "He's going to yell at me!"

"Yes, I am meeting John and Terry at the playground and I am late."  He grabbed his glove and bat and ran outside, right into a mud puddle from last night's rain.

It was Tuesday.  Tuesday was Square's favorite day.  Wednesday was nice because it was always Spaghetti Night.  Saturday was great because of the morning cartoons.  But Tuesday?  Tuesday was the day it always went to visit its friend Diamond.

It was a beautiful day!  The spring wind was blowing, and the sun was shining.  Square and Diamond went to play by the river.  

They were having a great time.  They swam.  They fished.  They played hide and seek.

Suddenly, the wind picked up.

"Hey, Square!  Would you like to see a trick?"

"Sure Diamond!  What is it?"

Diamond took a string out of its pocket.  Diamond tied it to her, and then she tied it to a tree.

"Watch this!"  Diamond jumped into the wind.  Suddenly, she was flying!  She floated.  She swooped.  She played with the clouds and the birds.  She flew faster.  She flew slower.

At first, Square was amazed.  But slowly, Square started to frown.

Diamond landed in front of her friend.  "What's wrong?"

"That was amazing!  It looks like a lot of fun.  But I am not shaped like a kite.  I can't do those amazing things like you."

Diamond smiled.  "Yes you can, Square!  Stand on your tip-toes!"

So Square did.

"Now, go look at yourself in the river."

Square walked to the river and looked down.  But he did not see a square.  He saw a diamond!

Diamond handed Square the string.  "Now jump!" she said.

Square jumped.  He jumped as high as he could.  Just as he started to fall, the wind blew and picked him up.

He was flying, like Diamond!

He floated.  He swooped.  He played with the clouds and the birds.  He flew faster.  He flew slower.

He soon landed.  The sun was setting, so they said goodbye and made plans to meet again next Tuesday.

The sun was rising in the morning and the birds were waking up. A mother bird was watching over her baby eggs in the nest. She laid four eggs yesterday, some white and some spotted. She had been keeping them warm so that her babies would soon be born. Little cracks appeared on the eggs and they started to grow and grow. Little "cheeping" sounds could be heard coming from inside, and soon the eggs cracked open. Featherless baby birds were inside, crying for food. The mother had nothing to give, so she quickly flew to the ground and looked in the dirt for food. She saw some worms wiggling in the ground.

Once upon a time I had a dog named Toodles. He was black and white and had long floppy ears. He also had very short legs, but really big paws. Every Saturday we would go to the park and play Toodles' favorite game. Toodles loved playing fetch. One Saturday, Toodles ran over to the pond because he saw ducks swimming there. He ran all around the pond, barking at the ducks. The ducks ignored him, and kept swimming. Toodles wasn't having it! He jumped into the pond and started swimming toward the ducks, chasing around his new playmates. One of the ducks, braver than the others, poked Toodles with his beak - and then bit him right on one of his floppy ears! Toodles barked and ran out of the pond because the duck hurt his ear. Soaking wet, he ran toward where I was eating a sandwich on the grass and curled right up in my lap so I could make him feel better. After that, whenever he would see a duck, Toodles would run the other way.

"I don't think I can win the race" Tim told his parents over breakfast. His mother asked "Why not?" but his father was silent. Tim knew his father didn't believe he could be a racer: only last year, he had sent Tim to a doctor to ask why his son wasn't a better runner. The doctor told him Tim could be anything he wanted to be, and maybe he didn't like to run. 

Tim, who had always preferred a good book to P.E. class, wanted to show his family that he really could be what they wanted him to be, so he spent his allowance on a pair of green running shoes and signed up for his school's Spring Fun Run. 

Tim answered, "I'm going to try to win, but Angela is so quick! No one ever beats her at recess." 

"Well, we'll be there for you, either way" his mother said.

Tim took an apple and walked to the bus. Since the race was after school today (school was letting out at 3:00 today, instead of 3:15), he knew he would be too nervous to think about anything else until it began. He didn't even bring his new book with him, an action book starring an orphan named Simon that Tim sometimes pretended to be.

3:30 arrived and the race was about to begin. All the other students had brought running shorts, but Tim was going to have to run in his school pants. Suddenly, he saw that his shoes were untied. As he bent down to tie them, one of the older boys kicked the back of his knee, making him fall down right as the race began. By the time he got up and tied his shoes, he saw he would finish in last place, as the other kids were much farther ahead of him. 

It was almost 4:00 before Tim saw the end of the run. By the time Tim reached the finish line, the group of parents waiting on their kids was very small, as some kids had been finished for a long time. Tim's father asked, "What took you so long? I'm surprised to see you here at all! Why did you sign up for this when we all knew you wouldn't win?" 

Tim thought about why he signed up. It wasn't about winning the race, or making his father proud. It was about finishing, and showing himself that the doctor was right: he could be anything he wanted to be, like his favorite character, Simon.

1: multiple: Why does Tim start out so far behind?
 A) He trips over his shoelace.
*B) He is knocked down.

Bill and Sarah chose to meet at the park on Saturday to play ball and have a picnic. They went to the same grade school together and lived on the same street down from the park. Sarah does not often like boys, but for a boy, Bill was alright. Most boys like Tom and Mark are stupid and a real pain, but Bill was a lot of fun to play with and didn't do dumb things like putting a booger on her back during recess. When Bill and Sarah arrived at the park, they first played ball in the grass near the playground. Then they chose to pretend that Bill was a monster and Sarah was the monster hunter. Sarah chased Bill all over the playground. They went in and out and up and down. Bill ran under the slide and stepped in a puddle. He didn't get hurt but he sure got plenty wet. Playing the monster game was the most fun that they had at the park that day. Later they sat in the grass for a picnic. They both took off their shoes so that Bill's feet could dry off and so that he wouldn't feel silly without shoes. Sarah took out her lunch and laid it out next to her. She had dried fruit and cheese and a peanut butter sandwich. Bill opened his lunch bag and found a coke, a bag of chips, and a ham salad sandwich. Sarah wanted to trade Bill his bag of chips for her fruit. He said that would be a fair trade and they enjoyed their lunch together. After they had their lunch, they lay back in the grass and watched the clouds. Some clouds looked like animals or shapes. Bill spotted one that looked like a reindeer.

Lions get very lonely sometimes but they have a difficult time trying to make friends. Lions have big teeth, sharp claws, and sometimes, they are very cranky. They don't always get along with other animals or humans, so they have to get rid of their anger and their crazy emotions to make and keep friends. Zebras and lions like to play tag, but sometimes it gets a little rough and zebra gets hurt. When that happens, a nice lion needs to say sorry and to try to find another friend. A lion might go up to a chicken and smile, or maybe a lion might bring a horse some flowers or food to make him or her less nervous. It's not easy to be friends with a lion, but a friendship takes time and a lot of hard work and that's what is most important! Also, my auntie always told me to be strong like a lion but to always be nice.

The bird by the river chirped twice before breaking into song, to tell all the other animals to sing along. The dog barked, the other birds sang, the squirrel squeaked, and the rabbit clapped its ears together. The cat did not because his mouth was hot from some very strong mustard. He thought to himself that he wouldn't have eaten that hot dog if he knew it was on it. He tried to look for water, but that mustard drove his nose crazy and he couldn't smell anything. Not even water. 

Luckily for the cat, cats have very good eyes, and he saw a puddle out of the corner of his eye. He ran to it. He wondered why the water was kind of yellow, and thought it must be from the leaves floating in the puddle. The cat took a big drink.

I stepped inside my mother's car and dropped my backpack on the floor as my face filled with excitement. Today's the day that we're going to the candy store and picking out a new treat to have after dinner. Some people may like going to the movies, or the game room, or even to parks, but going to the candy store once a week and getting to see all the different colors and taste all the different treats is my favorite activity. As soon as we pull up, she tells me to not run around too much inside, but I'm so excited I barely hear her. She opens the door and we walk inside where the clerk first welcomes us. Since we do this each week, he calls me by my name of Trevor and says that he's come up with a few candies for me to try. 

I walk over to the table and see three types of M&M's laid out. He knows I'm not a big fan of peanuts so he left out the peanut kind, instead giving me mint flavored, cookies 'n creme flavored, and white chocolate flavored. They all taste great and the clerk asks which I like the most. It takes me a bit to choose, but I finally choose the Mint as this week's choice. He rings us up at the front desk and says that since we buy from his shop so much, he's going to give us a sale, so we think it'll be a nickel or a dime or even a quarter off. Actually, the clerk ends up cutting it half off! We thanked him and went on our way as I tried not to eat all the way home.

There once was a little monkey who lived in a zoo. He was a tiny brown monkey, smaller than all of the others. He was quieter than the others too. He was so quiet, in fact, that his mommy monkey made him wear a small blue bell around his neck so that she could find him.

closer to the water. I called out to some people on a boat and they sailed over so I could

The first grade class went on a bus to visit a farm. The farm was a long ways from their
school. The farm was also far away from any other farms or houses. The farmers who lived
there were the Nixon family. They grew corn. Sometimes when the weather was right, they
would plant wheat, too. The fields were so large that the class could not see where they
ended. Mr. Nixon gave all of the children a long ride in the fields on his tractor. The
Nixon family also had a lot of farm animals. In the red barn next to their home, they kept
a few cows and horses. Everyone fed hay to some of the cows. The farmers got milk from
their cows. Some of the class got small bottles of fresh milk to take home with them. All
the kids got to ride on the big brown horses the Nixons had. They went up into the nearby
hills, where they could look down on the farm below. Around the farmyard there were many
goats and chickens, who wandered around as they wished. The Nixon children liked to play
with their goats, feed them peanut shells and pet them, like the first grade kids did with
their dogs and cats. The smallest tried to bump the children with their hard heads and
tiny horns! When it was almost dark, the school kids got back on the bus to go home. They
were a little sad to leave the fun life of the farm children. But they brought back
stories for all the rest of the school to hear.

I used to be afraid of butterflies!  It is true!  Once, my mom took me to Seattle.  There,
we went to a special place.  We went to the zoo!

I saw lots of animals at the zoo.  I saw bears.  I saw tigers.  I saw apes.  I saw
monkeys.  I saw snakes.  I loved seeing all these animals.  They made me happy.

We even saw one place where there were giant bugs and they didn't even scare me.  In
fact, I like bugs.  But there was one place where you walked inside a big room where there
were lots of plants and butterflies flying all over the place.  You could buy sugar water
to feed them and they could land on you.  My mom and brother were so excited to go in, but
I was scared.  I wasn't sure that I wanted to be in the room with butterflies flying
everywhere.  My mom said I would be okay.  My brother said I would be okay.  They said
butterflies were nice and beautiful.  They said they would not hurt me.  So I went in the
room.

Guess what?  I was so scared when one landed on me that I went screaming for the door!
The man watching the door to make sure butterflies did not escape or get hurt yelled at me
to stop.  He was mad at me for running out and not caring about the butterflies.  I said I
was sorry, but I was scared.  He checked me for butterflies and then let me get out of
there!

I stayed outside and my mom and my brother enjoyed the butterflies.

Since then, they would tease me about being afraid.  They would try and get me to not be
afraid.  Last year for my birthday, mom bought me a butterfly book.  She bought one for my
brother, too.  I tried really hard to not be afraid and to go out into the yard and find
butterflies with my brother.  It became really fun to do.  Once, a butterfly landed on me
and I laughed.  I liked it.  It tickled me.  It did not hurt me.  Now, I like butterflies!

Chocolate was a box turtle.  Lauren found her one day on the side of the road, hiding in
her old, worn shell, frightened by the cars going by.  Lauren picked Chocolate up to help
her cross the street, because Lauren knew that turtles are very slow and cars are very
fast.  After Lauren got Chocolate to the other side of the road, Chocolate peeked her head
out of her shell and looked at the little girl.  Lauren saw that not only was Chocolate's
shell worn, one of her eyes was shut.  Lauren thought Chocolate needed more help from her, so
Lauren took the turtle home.  Lauren hid Chocolate in her bathtub, because she was worried
that her mother would be mad. Lauren went to look up what turtles like to eat and left
Chocolate alone in the bathtub.  Lauren was still looking up  turtle facts when she heard
her mother call out, "Lauren, get in here now!"  Lauren knew she was in trouble.  But when
Lauren came into the bathroom, her mother was smiling.  Lauren's mom told her that she had
a turtle when she was a little girl.  Lauren and her mom took Chocolate to an animal
doctor who treated sick turtles.  The doctor gave them special drops to put in Chocolate's
eyes.  Lauren put the drops in Chocolate's eyes, like the doctor told her and soon the

A boy named Eduardo in a far away place is thinking about a girl he loves.

He is cold. It is snowing where he lives. He lives in Argentina.

It's warm where she lives in Hawaii. She eats fresh fruit.  Her shower is outdoors under
the warm sun as red birds fly around her. It is nice, but she misses him.

She remembers he is very pretty. She wondered if he would really love her always,  because
she is older.

He didn't care. Eduardo was poor, so he could not visit her. 

Maybe a time machine would help!! She can give back her birthdays! But she didn't want to
bring back any dinosaurs back by accident. Like last time.

Then an angel flew down from a star called the Pleiades to help her. His name was Eh. He
said, "close your eyes! Then remember the most happy you have ever felt! Let go of any
thing that feels like clouds. Imagine puppies hugging you, and kitties purring with
you. Imagine you are eating chocolate ice cream!

As long as you remember how to be happy  you can ALWAYS be as young as Eduardo! And you
can think of GREAT ways you can see him again!"

It worked! She had an idea. Someone in a place called MR was buying stories that people
wrote. She wrote one about her & Eduardo!

It paid for her airplane ride. Wow.

Then they were together again. Hugging each other in happiness, they said, "Thank you
everyone,  for helping us!"

Once upon a time, there was a boy named Freddy.   And Freddy loved his mom very much, and
his mom loved him very much too.  One day, Freddy went outside to ride his bike.  On the
way out, his mother told him, "Remember to wear your helmet," and Freddy grabbed his
helmet and met his friends outside.  When he was putting on his helmet, his friends told
him, "Helmets are for girls!  You're not cool if you wear a helmet!"  Freddy thought about
what his mom told him, but he wanted to be cool like his friends, and he took off his
helmet.

Freddy and his friends went on a long adventure, and they rode all the way to the top of
the largest hill in their neighborhood.  Looking down, Freddy was scared.  He had never
ridden down this hill before.  His friends said, "What are you, scared?"  Freddy did not

speeding up, going very, very fast.  He pressed his brakes, but oh no, his brakes weren't
working.  Freddy, speeding down the hill, did not know what to do.  He got to the end of
the hill and slammed right into a tree.  He awoke the next day in the hospital.

story.  He told her how we would never do that again, and how he would always wear his
helmet.  His mom gave him a big kiss on the forehead, and Freddy knew his mother was right
in the beginning.  She didn't have to say it.  In the end, Freddy learned that it's

Late in the evening, the wind blew hard around the little house. The sound of the wind is
like someone crying. It made the old woman nervous. She had not been getting much sleep
lately, but with the wind making the spooky noise, she didn't know what else to do but lie
down and try to rest a little.

Once she lay down to try to sleep, many memories of her life in the little house kept her

It was in this, her old bedroom, that she was trying to sleep. The crying sound got
louder. It didn't seem like it was outside. It sounded like it was coming from the other
side of the bed. When she turned and looked, she saw her younger sister. She still looked
five years old. The old woman couldn't remember her any other way, as she had died from a
sickness at age five.

"What's wrong?" she asked her sister. "I miss you. I am so lonely," answered the little
girl, who was so thin you could see through her. The old lady closed her eyes and reached
for her sister. That is how they found her the next day, holding her pillow and smiling.

The best afternoon I ever had with my grandfather was when we went down to the river and
fished.  It was a hot July day, and I was bored. My grandfather was sitting in the
backyard, reading. "Hey, you look like you need some fun," he said.  "Want to go fishing?"
I said sure, and he went to the garage.  He came out with two poles, some hooks, and some
fishing line. Everything was in pieces, but he showed me how to put it all together.  I
asked if we needed worms, and he said no. Then, we set off to the river.

It was only about ten blocks to the river, but walking along past the library and the
store, he told me about how he used to go fishing with his friend Steve. They used to
catch catfish, then take them home so that their mothers could cook them for dinner.  When
we got to the park at the river, my grandfather went right to the bank, then turned and
walked up along the side of the river until we were off in the shade under the trees right
at the edge of the park. There, he taught me how to throw my line in the water. Then we
sat down to wait. While we were fishing, my grandfather told me lots of stories about what
he and Steve did as kids. We didn't have any worms, so we never caught any fish, but
sitting there as he told me stories made it a great afternoon.

John thought about things that he liked to do.

Well, for one, he liked baseball. Compared to his friends, he was very good at the
sport. He didn't even have to practice that much. He remembered that he once hit the ball
so hard that it flew out of the park. Home run!

He was also a fan of basketball. He enjoyed watching people on television pull off crazy
tricks like slam dunking (but he didn't really like all of the passes). He wasn't quite
that good yet, but he was pretty good at making shots from the three point line. He knew
that if he kept practicing, he would be really great someday.

Finally, he loved football. Unlike baseball and basketball, he didn't play football
himself, but he was drawn to the games. He got a kick out of sitting in the stands,
cheering on his team and friends. He once cheered so loud that he could barely speak at
all for the rest of the day.

Luna the hawk wanted some socks. It was the middle of winter and sitting on tree branches
made her feet very cold. Luna hoped that her friends could help her find some socks. She
flew to the old maple tree where Olive the owl lived.

"Olive, may I please borrow a pair of your socks?" she asked.

Olive the owl looked surprised. "Luna, I have no use for socks because my legs and toes
have thick feathers. Go visit one of the animals that walk on four legs. They might have
extra socks you could borrow."

Luna flew across the field and landed next to the icy creek. Rose the raccoon was teaching
her six babies how to wash their paws. The water was very cold, but the babies were having
fun.

"Rose, my bare legs and bare toes are so cold, may I please borrow a pair of your socks?"
begged Luna.

Rose laughed hard. "Silly Luna, I do not have socks. Look at my legs and feet. They are
covered with thick, warm fur. I'm sorry I cannot help you. Go visit the humans. Sometimes
I tip over their garbage cans at night when I am looking for food. Once I saw a pair of
socks."

Luna was very afraid of humans. Her grandmother and mother had warned her about them. She
was told that some humans are mean and hurt hawks. Her feet were so cold that it was
difficult to grip tree branches. She became brave. She flew to the farmhouse on the big
hill. When she landed on the roof, she could not believe her eyes. She saw socks! In late
autumn, Henrietta the human had put laundry outside to dry and she had forgotten to bring
in one tiny pair of socks. The socks were hanging on the clothesline by two wooden
pins. Luna used her powerful beak to break the pins. She put on the socks and then flew
back to her home in the huge tree. When she landed, her feet were warm and dry. Luna was
very happy.

brought two shovels and two buckets. They both started digging holes in the sand with

It was a beautiful sunny and warm day. I was working outside in my garden. I was pulling
weeds which is not my favorite job, but I was enjoying the day. I live by a lake so
sometimes I take a break from my chores and look at the lake. It is so beautiful and it
makes me happy to look at the beautiful lake and see what animals I can find swimming in
or near the lake.

On this day, I kept hearing a low soft sound coming from the lake. I got up from my garden
and walked to the lake. I kept hearing this strange sound. It sounded like someone talking
in a very low voice. I thought it might be a lake bird because we see and hear them all of
the time. The lake birds have several different calls that tell what they want to "say" to
other lake birds. There is the call when they are flying which is very hurried and
short. Then there is the "where are you" call which is long, slow and loud. But this sound
was not like any I had ever heard. I went to get the binoculars to see if I could spot
anything. But, no luck. I still kept hearing this low talking sound. I had now totally
given up weeding. Finding this strange sound was going to be more fun. But where was it
coming from? I looked again up and down the lake and saw nothing. Finally I went around to
the other side of the place where we keep our boats. There is an area there where it is
not a very deep part of the water. I spotted them! It was a mother lake bird and a father
lake bird with a baby in between them. They were teaching the baby how to swim and eat
fish. The low talking sound that I heard must have been them trying to teach the baby to
swim and eat the fish. I sat there on the bank and watched for a half an hour. I felt very
special that I got to see this. It was such a fun thing to see and way more fun than
gardening.

Once there was a young boy named Bret who had a cat named Wolfgang.  The boy had really
wanted a wolf for a pet, but his mother said wolves liked to hog the bathroom and liked
to blow things down and they snored.  So the boy had to call his cat Wolfie.

He had also thought about naming his cat Sir Purrsalot.  Bret himself planned to become a
knight when he grew up (or maybe a cowboy) and thought Sir Purrsalot sounded like a good
name for his brother knight.  The difficulty there was that Wolfie didn't purr a lot.  He
purred when he was being fed or petted, but no one could say he purred a lot.  Plus Bret's
mother said knights liked to poke things with their swords and they also liked to hog the
bathroom and they clanked.

So Bret was left with a cat named Wolfgang.  The neighbors gave him strange looks when he
stood in the front yard in the evening and yelled "Wolfie!  Here Wolfie!!!", to get
Wolfgang to come in for the night.  But Bret didn't care what anyone else thought.  He had
a Wolfie and maybe he'd end up becoming a pet doctor when he grew up instead.

Once upon a time, there was a dog named Puddles. Puddles was lonely because he lived in an
area where there were no other dogs, but only cats. Day after day, Puddles would have to
eat cat food and do cat things in order to fit in with the rest of his group. He found it
very boring and Puddles was sad. Puddles didn't even look like a cat!

All of the other cats teased Puddles. "You're too big," they said. "You've got too long of
a nose!" "Why are you panting like that?" Puddles knew that he was different.

One day, Puddles chose to run away from all of the cats. The cats laughed at him. What a
stupid dog! Didn't he know that there were monsters in the woods that could eat him?
Puddles didn't care, because Puddles was sad enough to try.

So Puddles packed up his things - his squeaky ball, his water dish, and his bone - and
headed off into the woods. He was finally happy! All of a sudden, Puddles turned. He
smelled a funny smell. It smelled like something he had never smelled before. He turned

Once upon a time there was a princess who lived in a high tower and she was not allowed to
leave because of her mean mother. One day she chose to leave but her mother would not let
her. The princess climbed out the window of the high tower and climbed down the south wall
when her mother was sleeping. She wandered out a good ways. Finally she went into the
forest where there are no electric poles but where there are some caves.  There she met a
young man who was running. His name was John. John asked the princess why such a beautiful
woman like her was out in the middle of a forest. She said that she had been trapped for
her whole life by an evil woman who said she was her mother. The man said that he would
take the princess to a castle that was near. He also said that he thought that she may be
the missing princess. As they go through the forest they run into many problems. They see
that they are lost and have no way of finding where to go. After several days pass, the
princess climbs up to the top of a tree in order to find out where they are. She sees that
the castle where they want to go is not that far away and near a mountain. After thinking
of the best way to get there, John and the princess go to the castle where they live for
the rest of their lives.
